This project is about developing an administrative software for nurseries.
The project is based on the project "sepm_skeleton", which was offered to us 
and made the start easier.

The project utilizes Spring Boot and is configured as maven web application project with:
 - all relevant Spring Framework features enabled
 - embedded Tomcat with support for JSF2
 - embedded H2 in-memory database (including H2 console)
 - support for PrimeFaces

Just execute  "mvn spring-boot:run" to start the project and connect to
http://localhost:8080/ to access the nurseries web application. You may login
with "admin" and "passwd".
